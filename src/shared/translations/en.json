Subject to your compliance with the Terms, we grant you a nonassignable, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, and non-exclusive license to use the vApp on mobile devices that you own or control solely for your personal or internal business purposes. Because the vApp is locally installed, you are responsible for the security of the device on which it is installed, including ensuring that you keep anti-virus software current and otherwise protect the device on which the vApp is installed against malware. Vitreus is not responsible for any loss or damages – including loss of VTRS tokens or lockout from accounts accessed via the vApp – resulting from your failure to keep the device on which the vApp is installed safe and free of any malware. Vitreus cannot recover passwords or unlock account information stored on the vApp in any circumstances, including if the vApp is compromised by malware on your mobile device, and it is your sole responsibility to take all reasonable precautions to secure and backup your copy of the Software and the information stored on it.<br /><br />2.3 The vApp and related services are evolving and you may be required to accept or install updates to the vApp, or update third-party software (i.e., browsers or OS) to keep using the vApp or access their latest features, including security updates.

If you lose your recovery seed phrase, we cannot recover it for you. If you compromise your seed phrase, we cannot secure your Wallet for you.<br /><br />3.2 Once you have created your Wallet and secured your recovery seed phrase, you must verify your identity. This process requires you to provide a copy of your government-issued identification and a live photo to a third party service provider, Onfido, through a flow embedded into the vApp software.<br /><br />3.3 When Onfido verifies your identity, your NAC will be minted on Power Plant and your Wallet will be verified. At that time, you can connect your vNode to a power source and to your internet. Then you will connect your vApp to your vNode over WiFi and you will be prompted to create your User Account.

Your private key is the most important asset protected by the vApp since it is used as your only unique identifier when accessing and using most of the services provided on the vApp. Without your private key, you will not be able to access your Wallet or any other data tied to your NAC. In the event that you lose or damage your mobile device onto which you have downloaded the vApp, you may use your recovery seed phrase to generate an identical pair of public and private keys on the vApp installed on a new mobile device. With this, you can access all your vApp User Account, NAC credentials, your Wallet and any relevant services.<br /><br />4.2 Your recovery seed phrase is generated at random. If you forget your recovery seed phrase and your mobile device is lost or permanently damaged, you will not be able to recover the pair of public and private keys stored on your mobile device and you will not be able to access your User Account information (e.g., NAC, Wallet, VTRS tokens). For this reason, we strongly recommend writing down your recovery seed phrase and storing it in a secure location.<br /><br />4.3 You must always keep your recovery seed phrase safe, otherwise anybody who possesses it may recover the pair of your private and public keys stored on your mobile device. You should not show your recovery seed phrase to anyone. You should never enter your recovery seed phrase anywhere unless the mobile device instructs you to do so and you confirm your choice on your mobile device. Be aware that a digital copy of your recovery seed phrase stored online or at a drive accessible by multiple people may be easily stolen, so it is recommended not to upload the recovery seed phrase online or to any shared drives.<br /><br />4.4 Some third-party services allow you to recover the pair of public and private keys as well. You acknowledge that we guarantee the possibility of recovery only when you use the mobile device to generate the pair of keys to be recovered. We, however, do not and may not assume any liability for your failure to recover the pair of private and public keys using third-party services."

You can repeat this process multiple times to generate more than one seed. This master binary seed is then used to create all private keys and public keys that may be used as a unique identifier when accessing compatible services (such as cryptocurrency wallets). If you do this and you later forget your passphrase and your mobile device is lost or permanently damaged, you may not be able to recover the pair of public and private keys stored on your mobile device derived from the master binary seed and you may not be able to access your User Account (e.g., NAC, Wallet, VTRS tokens).<br /><br />5.2 For the above-mentioned reason, you must keep your passphrase safe and make precautions to remember the passphrase (e.g. write it down). You are solely responsible for keeping your passphrase safe from any third parties.<br /><br />5.3 You acknowledge that the passphrase, unlike the recovery seed, is transmitted outside the mobile device. Furthermore, you may set up a PIN. Please, be aware that if anyone takes possession of your mobile device, they may freely use any compatible services under your unique identity without any difficulties unless you set up a PIN. We therefore recommend that you set up a PIN. "

For guidelines on the setup procedure, please refer to the QR code on the vNode packaging or to the User Manual provided on the Website.<br /><br />4.2 Before you can set up and initialize your vNode, you must download the vApp. The vApp is available for use on iOS and Android devices. It may be downloaded from either the Apple App store or the Google Play store. Once downloaded, you must follow the prompts to create a Wallet that includes a 24-word recovery seed phrase. You must keep a copy of your seed phrase in a secure location. If you lose your recovery seed phrase, we cannot recover it for you. If you compromise your seed phrase, we cannot secure your Wallet for you.<br /><br />4.3 Once you have created your Wallet and secured your recovery seed phrase, you must verify your identity. This process requires you to provide a copy of your  government-issued identification and a live photo to a third party service provider, Onfido, through a flow embedded into the vApp software.<br /><br /> 4.4 When Onfido verifies your identity, your NAC will be minted on Power Plant and your Wallet will be verified. At that time, you can connect your vNode to a power source and to your internet. Then you will connect your vApp to your vNode over WiFi and you will be prompted to create your User Account. At this time, VTRS tokens awarded to vNode operators will be deposited into your Wallet."

Your private key is the most important asset protected by the vApp since it is used as your only unique identifier when accessing and using most of the services provided on the vApp. Without your private key, you will not be able to access your Wallet or any other data tied to your NAC. In the event that you lose or damage your mobile device onto which you have downloaded the vApp, you may use your recovery seed phrase to generate an identical pair of public and private keys on the vApp installed on a new mobile device. With this, you can access all your vApp User Account, NAC credentials, your Wallet and any relevant services.<br /><br />5.2 Your recovery seed phrase is generated at random. If you forget your recovery seed phrase and your mobile device is lost or permanently damaged, you will not be able to recover the pair of public and private keys stored on your mobile device and you will not be able to access your User Account information (e.g., NAC, Wallet, VTRS tokens). For this reason, we strongly recommend writing down your recovery seed phrase and storing it in a secure location.<br /><br />5.3 You must always keep your recovery seed phrase safe, otherwise anybody who possesses it may recover the pair of your private and public keys stored on your mobile device. You should not show your recovery seed phrase to anyone. You should never enter your recovery seed phrase anywhere unless the mobile device instructs you to do so and you confirm your choice on your mobile device. Be aware that a digital copy of your recovery seed phrase stored online or at a drive accessible by multiple people may be easily stolen, so it is recommended not to upload the recovery seed phrase online or to any shared drives.<br /><br /> 5.4 Some third-party services allow you to recover the pair of public and private keys as well. You acknowledge that we guarantee the possibility of recovery only when you use the mobile device to generate the pair of keys to be recovered. We, however, do not and may not assume any liability for your failure to recover the pair of private and public keys using third-party services."

You can repeat this process multiple times to generate more than one seed. This master binary seed is then used to create all private keys and public keys that may be used as a unique identifier when accessing compatible services (such as cryptocurrency wallets). If you do this and you later forget your passphrase and your mobile device is lost or permanently damaged, you may not be able to recover the pair of public and private keys stored on your mobile device derived from the master binary seed and you may not be able to access your User Account (e.g., NAC, Wallet, VTRS tokens).<br /><br />6.2 For the above-mentioned reason, you must keep your passphrase safe and make precautions to remember the passphrase (e.g. write it down). You are solely responsible for keeping your passphrase safe from any third parties<br /><br />6.3 You acknowledge that the passphrase, unlike the recovery seed, is transmitted outside the mobile device. Furthermore, you may set up a PIN. Please, be aware that if anyone takes possession of your mobile device, they may freely use any compatible services under your unique identity without any difficulties unless you set up a PIN.

The network employs VNRG, a unique resource generated by staking VTRS tokens, to serve as the fuel for transactions.

Unlike software nodes, which can be centrally hosted, vNodes are tangible units owned and operated by individuals around the world. <br /><br /> vNodes contribute to the network’s consensus mechanism, validate transactions, and help maintain the blockchain’s integrity. They connect to the internet, allowing them to participate in the network’s decentralized operations."
